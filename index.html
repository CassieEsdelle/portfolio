                    <p>As a complete beginner and newbie to the tech industry, I must say
                        enrolling on CBF Intro to Web Dev bootcamp was the best decision I've made.

                        medical administration, to education. I believe the following transferable skills,
                        vigilance, problem solving, analytical, organisation, communication skills. Will help with
                        my transition into the teach industry.

            <h3>Who is Cassie C Esdelle</h3>

            <p>Born in Trinidad and Tobago,a small island in the West Indies. I came to England 
                at the age of 10. The dream was to be a professional contemporary dancer.
                I studied National Diploma Dance, in my first year of college. Unfortunately
                that dream came to an end due a knee injury i was forced to quit dance.
