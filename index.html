            <section>I am currently learning the following topics...
                <ol>
                    <li>Introduction to programming command line and Git</li>
                    <li>Creating a repo/ branch/ cloning/ editing code and pushing via GitHub</li>
                    <li>Introduction to HTML, using emantic and non-semantic elements</li>
                    <li>Introduction to CSS, which is a styling langauge</li>
